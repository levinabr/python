    description = Write a program that simulates a simple bank ATM system.
    The user has an initial balance of $1000.
    The ATM should display a menu with options to:
        Check Balance
        Deposit Money
        Withdraw Money
        Exit
    The program should run in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
    For each option, use if, elif, and else to manage each choice.
    Ensure that the balance doesnâ€™t go below zero during a withdrawal.
